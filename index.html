<article class=first> <p> <h1 id=location>Where am I From?</h1>
     <small> I'm a 2nd-generation American Chinese born in 
        New York City, but I grew up in Great Neck, Long Island. 
        My parents are both from Hong Kong. I'm a product of two 
        worlds, one being the traditionally Chinese environment 
        taught by my parents, and the American environment that 
        interacting with my friends and teachers in grade school 
        provided. I cherish this upbringing, as it gives me a truly 
        unique heritage and cultural diversity. While I admit that 
        I may have a bit more of an American outlook than a Chinese 
        outlook by now, I do believe in keeping traditions and 
        roots alive.

    <small>I went to elementary, middle, and high school in 
        Great Neck, and I loved the feelings of home and 
        safety a suburban town gave. Great Neck was a sort 
        of bubble, where everything inside our town was very 
        self-contained and safe. Growing up and being old 
        enough to explore New York CIty was quite an experience. 
        There was so much around every corner to do! After high 
        school, I attended City College of the City University 
        of New York, and I now work as a financial assistant 
        at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Working here 
        has really expanded my knowledge of the greater world and 
        given me an indepth knowledge of cancer healthcare.

    <small>To me, food is the one thing I can always look forward to.
        I literally like everything (besides celery) and so 
        the thought of discovering new delicious and exotic 
        foods is one of my reasons of living. I also enjoy 
        reading and watching fantasy, sci-fi, romance novels 
        and movies. Such works can transport you to either a 
        fantastical or unique world apart from ours, and I 
        love exploring what that could feel like. In the same
        vein, traveling to other parts of the world fulfills 
        this love of exploration as well. Now that I'm in the
        workforce with an income, I quite enjoy traveling and
        discovering other cultures and food!</small>
